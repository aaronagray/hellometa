Reinvent the wheele.
End up writing your own framework.

Even if you use a collection of well known librarie, you lose the ability to bring other developers up to speed quickly. There's no way your frankenstein is documented as well as even the poorest framework documentation. If it is, then you should could release your code as opensource and, oops, add another framework to the 'churn'.

"It's not just about a framework featureset, frameworks also provide convention and structure. Convention and structure are a problem whether or not you choose to use a framework."

new developers can get ramped up quickly because a) they have experience in the framework or b) the framework is well documented.

"Frameworks aren't specific to Javascript. Almost every mainstream language I know of has a framework of some sort - If you're using a language on its own then I guarantee you'll end up writing (and testing/maintaining) similar code to everyone else. After a few years, you'll have built up a "utilities library" that you copy from project to project. This will need maintaining, and new starters will also have to learn your library."
